# [XPU] Gate FlashAttention-in-graph on oneAPI 2026.0+ runtime support

## Purpose

FlashAttention SYCL kernels use `sycl_ext_oneapi_work_group_scratch_memory`,
which SYCL Graph cannot capture before oneAPI 2026.0
([intel/torch-xpu-ops#3142](https://github.com/intel/torch-xpu-ops/issues/3142)).
On older runtimes, enabling XPU graphs with `FLASH_ATTN` and a full cudagraph
mode crashes at warmup with:

> `work_group_scratch_memory ... not yet available for use with the SYCL Graph extension`

and the practical guidance has been "FLASH_ATTN supports PIECEWISE only".

This PR makes full-graph FlashAttention capture available where the runtime
supports it, and safe everywhere else:

- `supports_xpu_fa_in_graph()`: `torch.version.xpu >= 20260000`.
- `VLLM_XPU_GRAPH_FORCE_PIECEWISE` (default **on**): clamps full graph modes
  to `PIECEWISE`, preserving today's behavior.
- Opt-out (`FORCE_PIECEWISE=0`) on a capable runtime keeps the requested
  `FULL` / `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` mode and logs `FlashAttention-in-graph enabled`.
- Opt-out on an incapable runtime falls back to `PIECEWISE` with a warning
  instead of crashing at warmup (fail closed).

## Required dependencies (do not merge this alone for production FA-in-graph)

This PR is **gating only**. The validated Arc Pro B70 / Ornith FA-in-graph
stack also requires the following companion PRs (please land / pin together
or treat as blockers for claiming full graphs support):

| Dependency | Why required |
| --- | --- |
| [vllm#48677](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48677) (draft) — torch 2.13 / oneAPI 2026 image | Runtime must report `torch.version.xpu >= 20260000` so `supports_xpu_fa_in_graph()` is true and SYCL Graph can capture FA scratch. |
| [vllm#49813](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/49813) — softcap/ALIBI forward + MXFP8 MoE prefer-XPU | Softcap/ALIBI must reach kernels; MXFP8 MoE must stay on XPU for the MoE graph path we validated. |
| [vllm-xpu-kernels#485](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-xpu-kernels/pull/485) — Split-K mix-batch decode | Needed for mix-batch decode shapes under graph capture. |
| [vllm-xpu-kernels#487](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-xpu-kernels/pull/487) — fail closed on missing FA2 shapes | Fail-closed default so missing FA shapes do not silently break graphs. |
| [vllm-xpu-kernels#488](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-xpu-kernels/pull/488) — native Xe2 MXFP8 / block-FP8 MoE | MoE path used in Ornith / MXFP4-MoE graph validation. |
| [vllm-xpu-kernels#489](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-xpu-kernels/pull/489) — fail closed on softcap/ALIBI | Matches softcap/ALIBI forwarding in #49813. |

Context (not merge blockers for this gate PR):
[intel/torch-xpu-ops#3142](https://github.com/intel/torch-xpu-ops/issues/3142),
[vllm#48946](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/48946) (PVC MXFP4 MoE
graph notes; Arc datapoint below).

`is_padding` WA cycle is already handled by kernels
[#481](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-xpu-kernels/pull/481) + Intel WAs
in vLLM — do not re-open here.

## Why this is not duplicating an existing PR

Duplicate-work checks (`gh pr list` / issue search on `vllm-project/vllm` and
`vllm-xpu-kernels`) found no open PR that adds `supports_xpu_fa_in_graph`,
the fail-closed FULL-mode clamp, or `VLLM_XPU_GRAPH_FORCE_PIECEWISE`. The
dependencies listed above are already open; this PR intentionally does **not**
re-bundle them.

## Test Plan

- [x] `pytest tests/utils_/test_torch_utils.py -k supports_xpu_fa_in_graph`
  (6 cases; no GPU required; pass in oneAPI 2026 container).
- [x] Dense canary: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, Arc Pro B70, torch 2.13.0+xpu
  (`torch.version.xpu=20260000`), oneAPI 2026.0 — eager vs FA-in-graph FULL.
- [x] Hybrid MoE canary: Ornith-1.0-35B-MXFP4 (MXFP4 MoE + GDN/Mamba), same
  device/runtime — eager vs PIECEWISE vs FA-in-graph FULL
  (auto → `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` for UNIFORM_BATCH backends). Correctness
  smokes S1–S7 vs eager.
- [x] Serving sweep (concurrency × length): graphs ON vs graphs OFF on the
  feature image (same serve profile).

## Test Result

### Unit tests

```text
pytest tests/utils_/test_torch_utils.py -k supports_xpu_fa_in_graph
# 6 passed
```

No `work_group_scratch_memory` / SYCL Graph error in any serve arm. On
incapable runtimes the fail-closed path clamps to PIECEWISE as intended.

### Correctness smokes — dense (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct)

| Check | Eager | FA-in-graph |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Short (`2+2` → `4`) | PASS | PASS |
| temp=0 within-arm byte-identical | PASS | PASS |
| Eager-compare greedy (128 tok) | — | identical for first **681** chars; diverge only at last ~1–2 tokens (bf16 near-tie); both coherent |
| NaN / `!{4,}` loops / empty | none | none |
| Serve log: `FlashAttention-in-graph enabled` | n/a | yes |
| Serve log: no scratch-in-graph error | n/a | yes |
| Mode resolve | NONE (eager) | `FULL` → `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` (FA2 UNIFORM_BATCH) |

### Correctness smokes — Ornith-1.0-35B-MXFP4 (S1–S7)

Arms: **A** eager, **B** PIECEWISE, **C** FA-in-graph FULL → `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`.

| Smoke | Result |
| --- | --- |
| S1 Startup / log hygiene | All Ready; no scratch/SYCL Graph error. B: PIECEWISE capture. C: `FlashAttention-in-graph enabled`; GDN stays outside FULL capture via UNIFORM_BATCH downgrade. |
| S2 Short decode (`2+2`) | `"4"` on every arm |
| S3 Long decode (512 tok) | Coherent; no loops / NaN / collapse |
| S4 temp=0 ×2 | Byte-identical **within** every arm (short + long) |
| S5 MoE routing (code / math / prose / multilingual) | Coherent + correct on every arm; no garbage |
| S6 GDN/Mamba state recall (~2k ctx) | `MAGNETIC-YELLOW-42` / `Dr. Elena Vasquez` **byte-identical** across A/B/C |
| S7 Eager-compare | S2 + S6 byte-identical A/B/C. Long free-form (S3/S5): identical prefixes; diverge only at a single greedy word-choice branch (bf16 near-tie), then coherent — **not** corruption |

Output agreement vs eager (byte-identical / similarity):

| Prompt | A vs B | A vs C |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S2 short | identical | identical |
| S5 code | identical | identical |
| S6 state recall | identical | identical |
| S3 long | sim 0.49 | sim 0.83 |
| S5 math | sim 0.53 | sim 0.63 |
| S5 prose | sim 0.71 | sim 0.71 |
| S5 multilingual | sim 0.94 | sim 0.94 |

## Scope / non-goals

- Default behavior unchanged (`FORCE_PIECEWISE=1`). FA-in-graph is opt-in.
- Does not bump Dockerfile / torch pins — **required** companion: #48677.
- Does not change kernels wheels or MoE oracle — **required** companions:
  #49813 and vllm-xpu-kernels #485–#489.
- Validated on Intel Arc Pro B70 + oneAPI 2026.0; PVC / other XPUs not
  re-run here.
